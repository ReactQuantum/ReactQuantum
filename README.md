<h2>What It Does</h2>
<p>React Quantum parses through your React application to create a color-coded tree representation of its component hierarchy. On hover, each tree node will display two key component performance metrics&mdash;**render time** and **re-render frequency**&mdash;as well as memoized state and props for added context. 

The beauty is in the heat map: Nodes will change color depending on the component's rendering speed, making it simple to pinpoint possible bottlenecks at a glance. :fire:</p>
