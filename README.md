<h4>What It Does</h4>
<p>React Quantum parses through your React application to create a color-coded tree representation of its component hierarchy. On hover, each tree node will display two key performance metrics, render time and re-render frequency, as well as memoized state and props for added context. Tree nodes will also change color depending on the component's rendering speed, making it simple to pinpoint possible bottlenecks at a glance.</p>
